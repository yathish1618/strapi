## 💻 Developing locally

When developing locally this Strapi template will connect to the Postgres server from its public [TCP Proxy](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/exposing-your-app#tcp-proxying)

- Enable the feature flag `Template Service Eject` in the [Feature Flags](https://railway.app/account/feature-flags) menu
- Within the service settings of the Strapi service click the `Eject` button on the upstream repository
- Clone that newly created repository locally
- Install Strapi's dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Install the Railway CLI
    - Instructions for that can be found [here](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#installation)
    - If this is your first time using the CLI make sure to login with `railway login`
- Within the local repository run `railway link` to link the local repository to the Strapi service on Railway
- Start Strapi for development with `railway run yarn run develop` or `railway run npm run develop`
    - This command will run Strapi in development mode with the service variables available locally
- Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:1337/admin`
